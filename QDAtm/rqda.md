Qualitative Data Analysis with RQDA
========================================================
Introduction
------------
This workshop covers the mechanics rather than the methods of performing a qualitative data analysis.  The examples will use the RQDA and RStudio.  

Obtaining the Software
----------------------
RQDA is available on both windows application servers Kiev and Moscow. It is also available on the linux network but you must ssh into finland to run it as it does NOT run on the webserver version.

Resources
---------
There is a terrific series videos on using RQDA on YouTube  [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL66CB2FF65368715C] (http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL66CB2FF65368715C).   I highly recommend them.
