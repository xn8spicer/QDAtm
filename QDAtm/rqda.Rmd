Qualitative Data Analysis with RQDA
========================================================
Introduction
------------
This workshop covers the mechanics, rather than the methods, of performing a qualitative data analysis.  The examples will use the RQDA package running under RStudio.  


Obtaining the Software
----------------------
RQDA is available on both windows application servers: Kiev and Moscow. It is also available on the linux network but you must ssh into finland to run it as it does NOT run through the webserver version.

Resources
---------
There is a terrific series of videos on using RQDA on YouTube  [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL66CB2FF65368715C] (http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL66CB2FF65368715C).   I highly recommend them.
