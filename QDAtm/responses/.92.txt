"just hang out, talk about our problems about the staff, what happened, our point reminders that aren't fair, and we talk about how mean the staff are, you can't tell the staff that you don't like them without getting in trouble, so we talk to each other about it which i think is the better way, but then the staff comes and interrupts us and puts us to work.  we get treated like crap."
